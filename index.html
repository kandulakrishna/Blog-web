            <p>“Three Rules of Work: Out of clutter find simplicity; From discord find harmony; In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.”
                <i><h4>Albert Einstein</h4></i> <br>
                
                “Think simple” as my old master used to say – meaning reduce the whole of its parts into the simplest terms, getting back to first principles.”
               <i><h4>Frank Lloyd Wright</h4></i> <br>
                
                The daily work we do – in school, at work or in a business – can easily become overwhelming, ineffective and suck the energy and joy out of what you are doing.
                
                So how can you work in a lighter, simpler way that helps you to get more of what truly matters done in less time and with less stress?
                
                Let me share 12 habits that I’ve discovered over the years that help me to do just that.

            <p>“Then followed that beautiful season… Summer… Filled was the air with a dreamy and magical light; and the landscape lay as if new created in all the freshness of childhood.”
                <i><h4>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</h4></i>
                
                “The time to relax is when you don’t have time for it.”
                <i><h4>Sydney J. Harris</h4></i>
                
                The summer is here.
                
                And for many of us it’s a time of vacations, a time of being free from school or a slow time at work or in your business.
                
                So it’s a good time to focus on taking extra good care of yourself to unwind, decompress and to recharge.</p>
